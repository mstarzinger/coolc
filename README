Cool Compiler for MIPS written in Haskell
=========================================

This is a compiler for Cool (the Classroom Object Oriented Language)
that targets the MIPS architecture and is entirely written in Haskell.
There are probably more compilers than programs out there that have been
written for this particular language and this is just one of these
compilers.

Why another one?
----------------

Compilers are in my opinion one of the most interesting topics in
computer science and for someone like me one of the most rewarding
challenges is to start working on a compiler from scratch. Also I wanted
to proof to myself and others that Haskell is in fact a wieldy tool to
implement a compiler.

Any Plans?
----------

There are none. It don't intend to continue hacking on this compiler nor
do I think that there is any particular direction where this pet project
could be heading. Feel free to fork though.
